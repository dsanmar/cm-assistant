"","2. 
Tapered leaf thickness (feeler) gauge 0.005 inch.  Use the same gauge as to be used to inspect the bolts after"

"","3. 
Steel section to mount bolt calibrator, such as a flange of girder or cross frame that is accessible from the ground."
"","4. 
Impact and manual wrenches to tighten bolts.  Equipment should be the same as to be used in the work."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Install bolt, nut, DTI, and standard washer into bolt tension measuring device.  Ensure that the assembly matches"
"","that to be used in the work unless bolts are too short to fit in the device.  If the bolts are too short, use longer"
"","bolts of the same diameter and from the same manufacturer to perform the DTI verification.  Test 3 assemblies"
"","for each rotational-capacity lot."
"","2. 
Tighten the nut to the tension listed in Table S-3-1.  Use another wrench on the bolt head to prevent rotation of"
"","the head against the DTI if the DTI is under the bolt head.  If an impact wrench is used, tighten to a load slightly"
"","below the required load and use a manual wrench to attain the required tension."
