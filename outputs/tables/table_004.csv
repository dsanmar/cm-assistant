"","8. 
With the bottom flap gate closed, fill the plastic standpipe to the top with water and then turn off the water."
"","9. 
Start the permeability flow test by opening the bottom flap gate to allow water to flow through the specimen."
"","10. 
Start the stopwatch when the water level drops to the first timing mark down from top of the standpipe."
"","11. 
Stop the stopwatch when the water level drops to the second timing mark down from the top of the standpipe."
"","12.  Record the time in seconds."
"","13.  Repeat the permeability test with additional compacted ASDC specimens for a total of 3 trials."
"D.","Calculations.  Calculate the permeability of each sample using the following equation:"
