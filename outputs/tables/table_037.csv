Further tighten the bolt to the rotation listed in Table S-1-3.  Measure rotation from the match mark in Step 4."

Loosen the assembly and remove nut to examine the threads on the nut and bolt.  Check for signs of thread"

"","stripping, or torsional distress fail the test."
"D.","Calculations.  Calculate the maximum allowable torque in foot-pounds as follows:"
"","Maximum Allowable Torque = 0.25 × P × D"
"","Where:"
"","P =  Measured initial tension in pounds"
"","D =  Bolt diameter in feet"
"","Compare the torque as measured in Step 5 to the maximum allowable torque.  If the measured torque is greater than"
"","the maximum allowable torque, the assembly fails the test."

Observations of the thread condition."

"B.","Apparatus.  Use the following apparatus:"
"","1. 
Calibrated torque wrench and spud wrench or equivalent."
"","2. 
Spacers and/or washers with hole-size no larger than 1/16 inch greater than bolt to be tested."
"","3. 
Steel section with normal size hole to install bolt.  Any available splice hole can be used with a plate thickness"
"","that will provide the number of threads under the nut required in Step 1 of the procedure."
