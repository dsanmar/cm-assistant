"","diameter of the concrete circle is a measure for the flowability of the SCC.  The visual stability index (VSI) is a visual"
"","evaluation of the segregation of the SCC during the slump flow test."
"B.","Apparatus.  Use the following apparatus:"
"","1. 
Mold in the shape of a truncated cone with the internal dimensions 8 inch diameter at the base, 4 inch diameter"
"","at the top, and a height of 12 inches."
"","2. 
Base plate of a stiff non-absorbing material, at least 30 inches square, marked with a circle marking the central"
"","location for the slump cone."
"","3. 
Hand-held wood or metal float or trowel."
"","4. 
Wheelbarrow or other container to hold at least 0.2 cubic feet of SCC."
"","5. 
Ruler or tape measure at least 30 inches long."
"","6. 
A scoop or suitable container for filling specimen molds with  SCC.  Experience has shown pails and plastic"
"","cylinder molds to be suitable containers."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Sample the freshly mixed SCC according to AASHTO T 141."
"","2. 
Observe the SCC in the wheelbarrow for segregation."
"","3. 
Moisten the base plate and inside of slump cone."
"","4. 
Place base plate on level stable ground.  Place the inverted slump cone centrally on the base plate and hold down"
"","firmly."
"","5. 
Fill the cone with the scoop or other suitable container in 1 lift.  Do not tamp, rod, or vibrate.  Strike off the"
"","SCC level with the cone with the trowel."
"","6. 
Remove any surplus SCC from the base plate around the cone."
"","7. 
Raise the cone vertically and allow the SCC to flow out freely."
"","8. 
Measure the final diameter of the SCC in 2 perpendicular directions."
"","9. 
Calculate the average of the 2 measured diameters (this is the slump flow in inches)."
"","10.  Rate the stability of the mixture in 0.5 increments by visual examination as specified in Table C-4-1."
