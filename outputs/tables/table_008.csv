"","9. 
If the air void content of all of the cores in the lot as calculated in Step 7 fall inside of the comparison limits as"
"","determined in Step 4, use the air void contents for the individual cores as determined in Step 7."
"","10. 
If the lot has an outlier or is a recore lot, the entire lot must be tested for maximum specific gravity.  Calculate"
"","air voids using each individual core maximum specific and bulk specific gravity."
"C.","Calculations.  Calculate the air voids for each core as follows:"
"","A − B"
"","Air Voids =  
 x 100"
"","A"
"","Where:"
"","A =  Maximum Specific Gravity"
"","B =  Bulk Specific Gravity"
"D.","Report.  Report the air void content for each core to the nearest 0.1 percent."
"","NJDOT B-4 – MEASURING THICKNESS OF HMA CORES"
"A.","Scope.  This test method is used to measure the individual lift thicknesses of drilled HMA cores."
"B.","Apparatus.  Use the following apparatus:"
"","1. 
Caliper device to measure the axial lengths of individual lifts to the nearest 0.001 inch mounted on a support."
"","2. 
Support  designed  to  hold  the  specimen  with  its  axis  in  a  horizontal  position  by  2  metal  roller  bearings"
"","sufficiently rigid and stable to maintain alignment without distortion or deflection."
"","3. 
Gauge to calibrate and check the zero reference point of the apparatus."
"","Ensure that the apparatus accommodates specimens from 1/2 to 12 inches in length."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
If the caliper device is electronic, turn it on.  Ensure that the caliper device is zeroed and set to the correct units"
"","of measure."
"","2. 
Place the specimen in the measuring apparatus with the smooth end of the core, which is the top or upper surface"
"","of the pavement, firmly against the zero reference point."
"","3. 
Take 4 length measurements approximately 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the specimen using"
"","the caliper device to measure the distance from the zero reference point (top of the core) to the bottom of the"
"","first lift.  If a measuring point is not representative of the plane of the core lift because of a small projection or"
"","depression, rotate the specimen slightly about its axis and take the measurement at the nearest representative"
"","point."
"","4. 
Read  each  of  the  4  measurements  for  the  lift  to  the  nearest  0.001  inch.    Calculate  the  average  of  the  4"
"","measurements for the lift to the nearest 0.01 inch and record."
"","5. 
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for each lift to be measured by measuring from the zero reference point (top of the core)"
"","to the bottom of the lift being measured."
"D.","Report.  Report the following to the nearest 0.01 inch:"
"","1. 
Average thickness of the first lift, which is the average distance for the first lift as determined in Step 4."
"","2. 
Average thickness of the second lift, which is determined by subtracting the average thickness for the first lift"
"","from the distance measured in Step 4 for the second lift."
"","3. 
Average  thickness  of  subsequent  lifts,  which  is  determined  by  subtracting  the  average  thicknesses  for  all"
"","preceding lifts from the average distance measured in Step 4 for the lift."
