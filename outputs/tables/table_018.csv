Mechanical sieve shaker conforming to AASHTO T 27."

"C.","Procedure.  The crumb rubber for asphalt rubber binder  is required to conform to the gradations specified below"
"","when tested in accordance with ASTM Designation C 136 except as follows:"
"","1. 
Obtain 100 ± 5 grams from the crumb rubber sample and dry to a constant weight at a temperature of not less"
"","than 135 °F or more than 145 °F and record the dry sample weight."
"","2. 
Place the crumb rubber sample and 5.0 grams of talc in a 1 pint jar, then shake it by hand for a minimum of"
"","1 minute  to  mix  the  crumb  rubber  and  the  talc.    Continue  shaking  or  open  the jar  and  stir  until  the  particle"
"","agglomerates and clumps are broken and the talc is uniformly mixed."
"","3. 
Place 1 rubber ball on each sieve.  After sieving the combined material for 10 ± 1 minutes, disassemble the"
"","sieves.  Brush remaining material adhering to the bottom of a sieve into the next finer sieve.  Weigh and record"
"","the weight of the material retained on the No. 8 sieve and leave this material (do not discard) on the scale or"
"","balance.  Ensure that observed fabric balls remain on the scale or balance and are placed together on the side of"
"","the scale or balance to prevent the fabric balls from being covered or disturbed when placing the material from"
"","finer sieves on to the scale or balance.  Add the material retained on the next finer sieve (No. 16 sieve) to the"
"","scale or balance.  Weigh and record that weight as the accumulative weight retained on that sieve (No. 16 sieve)."
"","Continue  weighing  and  recording 
the  accumulated  weights  retained  on 
the  remaining  sieves  until 
the"
"","accumulated  weight  retained  in  the  pan  has  been  determined.    Before  discarding  the  crumb  rubber  sample,"
"","separately weigh and record the total weight of the fabric balls in the sample."
"","4. 
Determine the weight of material passing the No. 200 sieve (or weight retained in the pan) by subtracting the"
"","accumulated  weight retained  on the  No. 200 sieve  from the  accumulated retained  weight in the pan.  If  the"
"","material passing the No. 200 sieve (or weight retained in the pan) has a weight of 5 grams or less, cross out the"
"","recorded  number  for  the  accumulated  weight  retained  in  the  pan  and  copy  the  number  recorded  for  the"
"","accumulated weight retained on the No. 200 sieve and record that number (next to the crossed out number) as"
"","the accumulated weight retained in the pan.  If the material passing the No. 200 sieve (or weight retained in the"
"","pan) has a weight greater than 5 grams, cross out the recorded number for the accumulated weight retained in"
"","the pan,  subtract 5 grams  from that  number and record the  difference  next  to the crossed out number.  The"
"","adjustment to the accumulated with retained in the pan is made to account for the 5 grams of the talc added to"
"","the sample.  For calculation purposes, the adjusted accumulated weight is the same as the adjusted accumulated"
"","weight  retained  in  the  pan.    Determine  the  percent  passing  based  on  the  adjusted  total  sample  weight  and"
"","recorded to the nearest 0.1 percent."
