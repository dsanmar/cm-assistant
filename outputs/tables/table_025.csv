"","NJDOT C-2 – QUICK-SETTING PATCH MATERIALS"
"A.","Scope.  This test method is used for determination of quick-set patch materials properties for approval and quality"
"","assurance."
"B.","Apparatus. 
  Use  apparatus  as  needed 
to  perform 
testing  according 
to  AASHTO  T  22,  AASHTO  T  27,"
"","AASHTO T 106, AASHTO T 126, AASHTO T 160, AASHTO T 197, AASHTO T 260, and ASTM C 672."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Preparation of Samples.  Prepare samples according to manufacturer’s recommendations.  If several design"
"","mixes are given, test the material with the highest allowable water amount that is consistent with its intended"
"","use as a patching material.  If the material is to be used at temperatures different than 70 °F, the ME may test"
"","the time of set, bond, and compressive strength at a different temperature in the allowable range of temperature."
"","2. 
Tests.  Test materials according to the following:"
"","a. 
Time of Set.  Run time of set test according to AASHTO T 197 except cardboard molds may be used."
"","b. 
Strength Development.  For Type 1 and 2, test 2 cubes per test according to AASHTO T 106.  For Type"
"","1A and 1B, make two 4 × 8 inch cylinders per test according to AASHTO R 39.  Cure specimens covered"
"","with a plastic cover over the cylinder for 3 hours and then cure without the plastic cover at 70.4 to 76.4 °F"
"","and 50 percent relative humidity until testing.  Test according to AASHTO T 22."
"","c. 
Bond Strength - Arizona Shear Method.  Prepare four 4 × 8 inch composite cylinders consisting of a"
"","base cylinder of hardened conventional concrete and an upper portion of the patching material."
"","Make the base concrete from 4 × 8 inch cylinders having a minimum compressive strength of 5,000 pounds"
"","per square inch.  Cut the cylinders into equal halves along a 30 degree angle with the vertical axis.  After"
"","being cut, etch the base cylinders with a 50 percent solution of hydrochloric acid and placed in 4 × 8 inch"
"","cylinder molds with cut face up."
"","When preparing the composite cylinders, brush a small amount of the patching material into the sawcut"
"","surface of the base cylinder.  Fill the remaining half of the cylinder mold with patching material using the"
"","standard  consolidation  procedures  defined  in  AASHTO  R  36.    Cure  specimens  covered  with  a  plastic"
"","cover over the cylinder for 3 hours and then cure without the plastic cover at 70.4 to 76.4 °F and 50 percent"
"","relative humidity until testing.  Remove the cylinders from the mold after 24 hours.  Test 2 specimens at"
"","7 days and 2 specimens at 28 days according to AASHTO T 22."
"","d. 
Expansion-Shrinkage.  Monitor change in  volume and length  from batching  until  the  materials reach"
"","equilibrium.  Prepare four 2 × 2 × 10 inch autoclave bars according to AASHTO T 160 for Type 1 and"
"","Type 2.  Prepare four 3 × 3 × 10 inch autoclave bars according to AASHTO T 160 for Type 1A and 1B."
"","Cure at 70.4 to 76.4 °F and 50 percent relative humidity for 24 hours.  Record initial reading after 24 hours,"
"","then place 2 bars in water bath in moisture room and leave the other bars in the initial curing conditions."
"","Take a reading on each bar every 24 hours until stability has been attained."
"","e. 
Durability. 
  Prepare  four  4  ×  8  inch  cylinders  for  each  material. 
  Test  2  cylinders  according  to"
"","AASHTO T 22 for 28 day compressive strength.  Test the remaining 2 cylinders as follows:"
"","1. 
Cure for 24 hours at 70.4 to 76.4 °F and 50 percent relative humidity, followed by 6 day cure in a"
"","lime water solution."
"","2. 
Following  the  7  day  cure  period,  begin  a  50  cycle  freeze-thaw  test.    Each  cycle  will  consist  of"
"","16 hours freeze (air) and 8 hours thaw (solution).  Proportion the durability solution by weight of"
"","96 percent water, 3.2 percent sodium chloride, and 0.8 percent calcium chloride."
"","3. 
After every tenth cycle, examine cylinders visually and record condition according to ASTM C 672."
"","4. 
At the end of the 50 cycles, perform compressive test according to AASHTO T 22 and report the"
"","results as a percentage of the 28 day compressive strength result."
"","f. 
Permeability.  Prepare one 4 × 8 inch cylinder and cure for 24 hours at 70.4 to 76.4 °F and 50 percent"
"","relative humidity.  Sawcut the cylinder into two 4 × 4 inch cylinders.  Seal all sides and the bottom with"
"","hot paraffin, leaving the sawcut surface exposed.  Place cylinders in durability solution noted in Step e for"
