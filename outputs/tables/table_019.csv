"","7. 
Level Surface.  Level surface not directly on the ground."
"","8. 
Heat Source.  A controllable heat source (i.e. a hot plate, gas stove, or burner) to maintain the temperature of"
"","the asphalt-rubber sample at 350 ± 3 °F while measuring viscosity."
"","9. 
Personal Equipment.  Eye protection and heat resistant gloves."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Calibration of Equipment.  Calibrate the equipment as follows:"
"","a. 
Verify  the  accuracy  of  the  viscometer  by  comparing  the  viscosity  results  obtained  with  the  hand  held"
"","viscometer to 3 separate calibration fluids of known viscosities ranging from 1,000 cP to 5,000 cP.  The"
"","known viscosity value are based on the fluid manufacturer’s standard test temperature or based on the test"
"","temperature versus viscosity correlation table provided by the fluid manufacturer."
"","b. 
The viscometer is considered accurate if the values obtained are within 300 cP of the known viscosity."
"","c. 
Verify the calibration of the rotational viscometer using viscosity standards before use at each site."
"","2. 
Sampling  Asphalt-Rubber  Binder.    Provide  new  sample  containers  and  ensure  that  they  are  clean  before"
"","using.  Before sampling, draw at least 1 gallon from an appropriate sample valve on the interaction tank and"
"","discard.  Then reopen the sample valve and draw at least 3/4 of a gallon for testing."
"","3. 
Preparing Asphalt-Rubber Binder Samples for Testing.  Prepare the asphalt-rubber binder as follows:"
"","a. 
Immediately transport the sample to the testing area.  Ensure that the testing area is close to the sampling"
"","location to reduce the potential for temperature loss."
"","b. 
Set the open asphalt-rubber binder sample container on the level surface on or over the heat source."
"","c. 
To prevent scorching or burning, manually stir the asphalt-rubber binder sample using a metal stir rod or"
"","the temperature probe."
"","d. 
Continue stirring until a consistent asphalt-rubber binder temperature of 350 ± 3 °F is achieved.  Record"
"","the actual test temperature with the corresponding viscosity measurement."
"","e. 
Insert the viscometer spindle and rotor into the hot asphalt-rubber binder sample near the edge of the can."
"","Ensure that the spindle and rotor are not inserted deeper than the immersion depth mark on the shaft and"
"","are not plugging the vent hole.  During insertion, the spindle and rotor may be tilted slightly to keep the"
"","vent hole clear."
"","f. 
Allow the rotor to acclimate to the temperature of the asphalt-rubber binder for approximately 1 minute."
"","During acclimation, stir the sample thoroughly and measure the temperature."
"","g. 
Orient the sample and the rotor so that the rotor is near the center of the sample, align the depth mark on"
"","the shaft with the asphalt-rubber binder surface, and level the viscometer in order to measure viscosity."
"","4. 
Testing.  Analog viscometers include a level bubble to help orient the device to ensure that the rotor and shaft"
"","remain vertical.  Digital viscometers may not include a level bubble.  If a level bubble is not included, attach a"
"","small adhesive bubble to the viscometer or use a framework with a level bubble."
"","Test the asphalt-rubber binder as follows:"
"","a. 
As soon as the viscometer is leveled and the depth mark is even with the asphalt-rubber binder surface,"
"","begin rotor rotation.  When using a digital viscometer, activate the continuous digital display according to"
