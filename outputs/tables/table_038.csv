"Procedure.  Perform the following steps:",""
"1.","Before testing, verify that the bolt is too short for testing as specified in NJDOT S-1."
"2.","Mark on the first 3 to 5 threads that are located closest to the bolt head."
"3.","Insert the bolt into the steel section using shim plates or washers under the bolt head, as needed, to ensure that"
"","the 3 to 5 threads that were marked in Step 2 are just visible from the opposite side.  Assemble a washer and"
"","nut onto the bolt up to the marked threads.  Use a rotational capacity washer from the same rotational-capacity"
"","lot as the bolt and nut.  If a washer is not required for the installation, use an ASTM F 436 washer of the proper"
"","diameter for the test."
"4.","Snug the bolt using a hand wrench.  Do not exceed 20 percent of the torque determined in Step 6."
"5.","Match mark a corner of the nut and the plate."
"6.","Using the torque wrench, tighten the nut to the rotation listed in Table S-2-1.  Use a second wrench to prevent"
"","rotation of the bolt head during tightening.  Record the torque required to reach this rotation.  Measure and"
"","record the torque required to reach the rotation with the nut in motion."
