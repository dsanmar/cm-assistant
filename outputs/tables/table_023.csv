"","NJDOT C-1 – DETERMINING YIELD OF CONCRETE PRODUCED BY"
"","CONTINUOUS-MIXING-TYPE TRUCK MIXERS"
"A.","Scope.    This  test  method  is  used  to  determine  the  yield  of  concrete  that  is  proportioned  volumetrically  in  a"
"","continuous-mixing-type truck mixer."
"B.","Apparatus.    The  apparatus  will  consist  of  a  1/4  cubic  yard  container  having  dimensions  of  36  ×  36  ×  9  inches."
"","Construct the container using materials that do not become deformed when filled with concrete."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Set all controls of the mixer unit at the settings approved for the mix design being checked."
"","2. 
Activate  the  mixer  and  discharge  sufficient  material  to  fill  the  mixing  auger  assembly  and  discharge  chute."
"","Then deactivate the mixing unit."
"","3. 
Reset cement meter to zero and reactivate the mixer and discharge material into the 1/4 cubic yard container"
"","until it is level-struck full, making provision for the material settling into all corners."
"","4. 
Record the count as shown on the cement meter."
"D.","Calculation.  Calculate the cement count that is equivalent to the amount of cement specified in the mix design for"
"","1/4 cubic yard.  Calculate the yield by dividing the actual cement count by the specified count and multiplying by"
"","100.  The result will be 100 ± 2 percent."
"E.","Report.  Report the yield to the nearest 0.1 cubic yard."
