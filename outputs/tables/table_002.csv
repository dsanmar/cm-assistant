"","4. 
Sieve the quartered sample through the 1/2 in. (12.6 mm), 3/8 in. (9.5 mm), and 1/4 in. (6.3 mm) sieves.  Discard"

"","5. 
Count the aggregate particles obtained in Step 4.  The total sample count must be a minimum of 200 particles"

"","6. 
Try to pass each of the particles of the sample through the 1/4 in. (6.3 mm) slot of the thickness gauge.  Separate"
"","the particles passing through the gauge from those retained on the gauge."
"","7. 
Combine all particles retained on the gauge and count.  The total is Retained Sample."
"","8. 
Combine all particles passing through the slot and count.  The total is the Passing Sample."
"D.","Calculations.  Use the following calculations to determine Flakiness Index:"

"","Retained Sample Particle Count  +  Passing Sample Particle Count"
"","Report the Flakiness Index to the nearest whole number."
