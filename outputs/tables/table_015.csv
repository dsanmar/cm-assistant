"Scope.  This test method is used to determine the susceptibility of HMA specimens to fatigue or reflective cracking.",""
"This test method measures the number of cycles to failure.",""
"Apparatus.  Use the following apparatus:",""
"1.","Overlay Tester.  An electro-hydraulic or electro-pneumatic system that applies repeated direct tension loads to"
"","specimens.    The  machine  features  2  blocks,  one  is  fixed  and  the  other  slides  horizontally.    The  device"
"","automatically measures and records a time history of load versus displacement every 0.1 second at a selected"
"","test temperature."
"","The  sliding  block  applies  tension  in  a  cyclic  triangular  waveform  to  a  constant  maximum  displacement  of"
"","0.06 centimeter (0.025 in).  This sliding block reaches the maximum displacement and then returns to its initial"
"","position in 10 seconds (one cycle)."
"2.","Temperature Control System.  The temperature chamber must be capable of controlling the test temperature"
"","with a range of 50 to 95 ºF (10 to 35 ºC)."
"3.","Measurement  System.    Fully  automated  data  acquisition  and  test  control  system.    Load,  displacement,  and"
"","temperature are simultaneously recorded every 0.1 second."
