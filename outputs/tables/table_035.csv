"D.","Installation and Testing."
"","1. 
Fixture and Specimen Installation:  Install fixtures in the testing machines so that they are aligned vertically"
"","and horizontally.  Install specimens in the fixtures so that loading points are contacted."
"","2. 
Test Speed:  Ensure a maximum test speed of 0.01 in/min."
"E.","Calculations.  Calculate the flexural modulus for the ring specimens in tension using the following equation:"

"","NJDOT R-1 – DETERMINING RIDE QUALITY OF PAVEMENT SURFACES"
"A.","Scope.  This test method is used to determine the ride quality of a pavement surface using a Class 1 Inertial Profiler"
"","System  (IPS).    If  any  part  of  this  test  procedure  is  in  conflict  with  the  referenced  documents,  such  as  ASTM  or"
"","AASHTO standards, this test procedure takes precedence for its purpose."
"B.","Apparatus.  Use the following apparatus:"
"","1. 
Class 1 IPS that meets the requirements of ASTM E 950, Sections 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 of AASHTO M 328, and"
"","the following:"
"","a. 
Valid certification approved by the Department."
"","b. 
The data system provides the raw profile data in an ASCII format acceptable to the Department."
"","c. 
Current version of ROADRUF, ProVal, or other Department approved pavement profile analysis software"
"","installed on the IPS computer to compute the IRI.  Obtain approval prior to performing ride quality testing."
"","2. 
Base plate and gauge blocks, of 1 inch and 2 inch thickness, provided by the manufacturer to verify daily vertical"
"","calibration."
"","3. 
Retroreflective traffic marking tape or other approved mechanism to automatically trigger the start and stop of"
"","profile measurements."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Turn  on  the  inertial  profiler  and  warm  up  all  electronic  equipment  in  accordance  with  the  manufacturer"
"","recommendations in advance of testing."
"","2. 
Perform Block and Bounce tests each day prior to collecting data.  Record the results in the calibration log."
"","Ensure tolerances are within the certified limits."
"","3. 
Ensure retroreflective traffic marking tape or other approved mechanism is placed at the beginning and end of"
"","each direction of travel lane."
"","4. 
Enter Project information in the system."
