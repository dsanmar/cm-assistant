"","NJDOT B-8 – DETERMINING JOB MIX FORMULA FOR MODIFIED OPEN-GRADED"
"","FRICTION COURSE MIXES"
"A.","Scope.  This test method is used to determine gradation and the percent asphalt in a MOGFC mixture.  The gradation"
"","is verified to ensure stone-on-stone contact, and the impact resistance of the  final JMF is verified.  The optimum"
"","asphalt content (AC) is determined from: (1) aggregate surface area, (2) relative Voids in Mineral Aggregate (VMA),"
"","and (3) visual drain-down determination of asphalt content.  A simple average of these 3 criteria is used to determine"
"","the JMF asphalt content."
"B.","Apparatus.  Use the following apparatus:"
"","1. 
Equipment as needed for AASHTO T 19."
"","2. 
Equipment as needed for Superpave mix design as specified in AASHTO T 312."
"","3. 
Equipment as needed for AASHTO T 209."
"","4. 
Ovens capable of maintaining temperatures as specified in this method."
"","5. 
Clear, glass (Pyrex) 9 inch diameter pie pans."
"","6. 
L.A. Abrasion Machine conforming to AASHTO T 96."
"","7. 
Equipment as needed for AASHTO T 85."
"","8. 
No. 4 sieve according to AASHTO M 92."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Verification of Stone-On-Stone Contact.  Choose the design gradation to meet the air void requirements and"
"","to ensure that the aggregate skeleton exhibits stone-on-stone contact.  Sieve aggregates proportioned to meet"
"","the selected JMF gradation over a No. 4 sieve.  Keep the material retained on the No. 4 sieve as the coarse"
"","aggregate fraction.  Determine the unit weight Guwca of the coarse aggregate fraction of the aggregate using the"
"","dry rodding technique according to AASHTO T 19  For the selected JMF, determine the voids in the coarse"
"","aggregate of the mix (VCAmix) based on specimens compacted with 50 gyrations according to AASHTO T 312."
