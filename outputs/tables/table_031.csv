"","1.

"","NJDOT C-5 – STATIC SEGREGATION OF HARDENED SELF-CONSOLIDATING"
"","CONCRETE CYLINDERS"
"A.","Scope.  This test method is used for determining the static segregation resistance (stability) of SCC using hardened"
"","test specimens.  This method provides a visual assessment of static segregation resistance of SCC using a Hardened"
"","Visual Stability Index (HVSI) rating to evaluate molded or cored hardened concrete cylinders cut lengthwise in 2."
"B.","Apparatus.  Use the following apparatus:"
"","1. 
4  ×  8 
inch  cylinder  molds  for  casting  concrete 
test  specimens  shall  conform 
to 
the  requirements  of"
"","AASHTO M 205."
"","2. 
Hand-held wood or metal float or trowel."
"","3. 
A  saw  with  a  diamond  or  silicon-carbide  cutting  edge  and  capable  of  cutting  specimens  without  excessive"
"","heating or shock."
"","4. 
A suitable container for filling specimen molds with  SCC.  Experience has shown pails and plastic cylinder"
"","molds to be suitable containers."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Sample plastic SCC according to AASHTO T 141."
"","2. 
Mold two 4 × 8 inch test specimens as near as practical to the place where they are to be stored.  If it is not"
"","practical to mold the specimens where they will be stored, move them to the place of storage immediately after"
"","strike off.  Place molds on a rigid surface free from vibration and other disturbances.  Ensure that the supporting"
"","surface is level to within 0.25 inch per foot."
"","3. 
Fill the specimen molds in 1 lift poured using a suitable container without vibration, rodding, or tapping."
"","4. 
Strike off the surface of the concrete level with the top of the mold using a float or trowel."
"","5. 
Immediately after molding and finishing, cap the specimens with a plastic cylinder lid or cover with a plastic"
"","bag.  Store for a period up to 24 hours at a minimum temperature of 60 °F."
"","6. 
Before subjecting the specimens to sawing, ensure that they have been cured for a minimum curing period of"
"","24  hours  or  have  attained  a  minimum  compressive  strength  of  900  pounds  per  square  inch  according  to"
"","AASHTO T 22."
"","7. 
Saw specimens lengthwise down the center.  If a specimen cannot be satisfactorily sawed smooth due to lack"
"","of curing, then do not disturb the remaining specimens for an additional minimum curing period of 24 hours."
"","8. 
Make  a  visual  assessment  of  the  cut  planes  of  the  hardened  concrete  cylinder  or  core  using  the  criteria  in"
"","Table C-5-1.  Wet the cut planes to facilitate visual inspection."
