"3.","Mixing and Reducing Samples.  Mix the sample taken from the truck using a scoop.  Clean all tools by scraping"
"","with spatulas before and after each remixing to prevent build-up of asphalt and fines on the tools.  Do not use"
"","solvents to clean tools between uses.  After mixing, reduce the sample as follows:"
"","a. 
Gyratory Specimen.  Scoop a representative portion of HMA from the container of material to be molded"
"","into one specimen for volumetric testing according to AASHTO T 312.  Ensure that the HMA is at the"
"","specified compaction temperature when molding the specimen."
"","b. 
Composition  Sample.    After  the  removal  of  material  for  the  gyratory  specimen,  remix  the  remaining"
"","material.  Perform composition testing by the ignition method by taking a representative sample from the"
"","remixed material and testing according to AASHTO T 308.  If composition analysis is being performed"
"","by hot bin analysis, NJDOT B-5, a composition sample of HMA mix is not necessary."
"","c. 
Maximum  Specific  Gravity Sample.    Remix the remaining  material.  Take a  sample for determining"
"","maximum specific gravity and test according to AASHTO T 209."
"","d. 
Comparison  Sample. 
  Remix  the  remaining  material  and  prepare  a  comparison  sample  weighing"
"","approximately 9 pounds.  Place the comparison sample in a container that is sealed and labeled.  Store the"
"","comparison sample at the plant for at least 3 months so it will be available for selection by the ME."
"4.","Identifying  Samples.    Identify  samples  by  lot  number  and  position  in  the  lot’s  sampling  sequence.    Use  a"
"","number followed by a letter to identify the sample.  Use the lot number as the number and label the first, second,"
"","third, fourth, and fifth samples in the lot as “A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, and “E”, respectively.  If multiple samples are"
"","taken from the same truckload of mix, assign the same identification code to each of the samples."
