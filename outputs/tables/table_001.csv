"","NJDOT A-6 – DETERMINING GRADATION OF DENSE-GRADED AGGREGATE"
"","CONTAINING RAP"
"A.","Scope.  This test method is used to rapidly determine the gradation of DGA containing more than 10 percent RAP."
"","Due  to  the  melting  and  adhering  of  the  asphalt  portion  of  RAP,  typical  oven  or  hotplate  drying  of  the  sample  is"
"","detrimental.  This test method is a modification of AASHTO T 27."
"B.","Apparatus.  Use apparatus according to AASHTO T 2, T 11, T 27, and M 92."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Sieve a minimum 5,000 gram sample of DGA without drying (wet-sieved) through the following sieves:  2 inch,"
"","1 1/2 inch, 3/4 inch, and No. 4.  Weigh the material retained on each sieve and the material passing the No. 4"
"","sieve.  Record the weights."
"","2. 
Reduce the material passing the No. 4 sieve to a 500 gram sample."
"","3. 
Spread  the  500  gram  sample  out  in  a  pan  and  put  it  in  an  oven  preheated  to  175  ±  5  °F  for  approximately"
"","1.5 hours.    At  15  minute  intervals,  remove  the  sample  from  the  oven  and  weigh  it.    Remix  the  material  to"
"","promote even and thorough drying then return it to the oven.  Continue to dry the material until it reaches a"
"","constant weight."
"","4. 
After drying the material passing the No. 4 sieve to a constant weight, record the final weight."
"","5. 
Wash the material passing the No. 4 sieve according to AASHTO T 11 and dry the sample using the procedure"
"","in Step 3."
"","6. 
Determine the gradation of the sample according to AASHTO T 27."
"","7. 
Mathematically combine the gradation results of the plus No. 4 and minus No. 4 portions of the material for a"
"","final gradation."
"D.","Report.  Report the mathematically combined gradation results reported as a total percent passing the required sieves."
"","NJDOT A-7 – DETERMINING FLAKINESS INDEX"
"A.","Scope.    Use  this  test  method  to  determine  the  percentage  of  particles  in  a  coarse  aggregate  material  that  have  a"
"","thickness (smallest dimension) of less than approximately one-half of the nominal size."
"","Note: For purposes of this test method, only NJDOT specified #8 or approximately equivalent NJDOT *8 for use in"
"","UTFC and Chip Seal are to be considered."
"B.","Apparatus"
"","1. 
Standard U.S. sieves meeting the requirements of AASHTO M 92, in the following sizes:"
"","a. 
1/2 in. (12.6 mm)"
"","b. 
3/8 in. (9.5 mm)"
"","c. 
1/4 in. (6.3 mm)"
"","2. 
Metal thickness gauge, made of 12 gauge carbon steel sheet."
"","3. 
Scoop, brass wire brush, bristle brush, and other miscellaneous laboratory equipment."
"","4. 
Sample splitter, quartering machine, quartering cloth, or shovel and a smooth surface."
"","5. 
Forced draft oven, capable of maintaining the temperatures specified in the test procedure."
"C.","Procedure"
"","1. 
Obtain a representative sample of processed aggregates in accordance with AASHTO T 248."
"","2. 
Place aggregate sample in an oven and dry between 100 – 300 °F (38 – 150 °C) until sufficiently dry for testing."
