"","4. 
Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT).  Used to measure the horizontal displacement of the specimen"
"","( 0.25 in).  Refer to manufacturer for equipment accuracy for LVDT."
"","5. 
Electronic Load Cell.  Used to measure the load resulting from the displacement (5,000 lb capacity).  Refer to"
"","manufacturer for equipment accuracy for load cell."
"","6. 
Specimen Mounting System.  Used two stainless steel base plates to restrict shifting of the specimen during"
"","testing.  The mounting jig holds the two stainless steel base plates for specimen preparation."
"","7. 
Cutting Template."
"","8. 
Two  Part  Epoxy.    Two  part  epoxy  with  a  minimum  24  hour  tensile  strength  of  600  pound  per  square  inch"
"","(4.1 MPa) and 24 hour shear strength of 2,000 pound per square inch (13.8 MPa)."
"","9. 
10 pound weight (4.5 kg).  Used to place on top of specimens while being glued to specimen platens."
"","10. 
1/4 inch Width Adhesive Tape.  Placed over gap in plates to prevent the epoxy from bonding the plates together."
"","11. 
Paint or Permanent Marker.  Used to outline specimens on platens for placement of epoxy."
"","12. 
3/8 inch Socket Drive Handle with a 3 inch (7.6 cm) extension."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
Sample Preparation."
"","a. 
Laboratory Molded Specimens – Use cylindrical specimens that have been compacted using the gyratory"
"","compactor (AASHTO T 312).  Specimen diameter must be 6 inches (150 mm) and a specimen height must"
"","be 4.5 inches  0.2 inches (115  5 mm)."
"","Note - Experience has shown that molded laboratory specimens of a known density usually result in a"
"","greater density (or lower air voids) after being trimmed.  Therefore, it is recommended that the laboratory"
"","technician  produce  molded  specimens  with  an  air  void  level  slightly  higher  than  the  targeted  trimmed"
"","specimen.  Determine the density of the final trimmed specimen in accordance with AASHTO T 166."
"","b. 
Core Specimens – Specimen diameter must be 6 inches  0.1 inch (150 mm  2 mm).  Determine the"
"","density of the final trimmed specimen in accordance with AASHTO T 166."
"","2. 
Trimming of Cylindrical Specimen.  Before starting, refer to the sawing device manufacturer’s instructions"
"","for cutting specimens."
"","a. 
Place the cutting template on the top surface of the laboratory molded specimen or roadway core.  Trace"
"","the location of the first 2 cuts by drawing lines using paint or a permanent maker along the sides of the"
"","cutting template."
"","b. 
Trim  the  specimen  ends  by  cutting  the  specimen  perpendicular  to  the  top  surface  following  the  traced"
"","lines.  Discard specimen ends."
"","c. 
Trim off the top and bottom of the specimen to produce a sample with a height of 1.5 inches  0.02 inches"
"","(38 mm  0.5 mm)."
"","d. 
Measure the density of the trimmed specimen in accordance with AASHTO T 166.  If the specimen does"
"","not meet the density requirement as specified for performance testing for the mix being tested, then discard"
"","it and prepare a new specimen."
"","e. 
Air  dry  the  trimmed  specimen  to  constant  mass,  where  constant  mass  is  defined  as  the  weight  of  the"
"","trimmed specimen not changing by more than 0.05 percent in a 2 hour interval."
"","3. 
Mounting Trimmed Specimen to Base Plates (Platens)."
"","a. 
Mount and secure the base plates (platens) to the mounting jig.  Cut a piece of adhesive tape approximately"
"","4.0 inches (102 mm) in length.  Center and place the piece of tape over the gap between the base plates."
"","b. 
Prepare the epoxy following manufacturer’s instructions."
"","c. 
Cover a majority of the base plates (platens) with epoxy, including the tape.  Glue the trimmed specimen"
"","to the base plates."
"","d. 
Place  a  10  pound  (4.5  kg)  weight  on  top  of  the  glued  specimen  to  ensure  full  contact  of  the  trimmed"
"","specimen to the base plates.  Allow the epoxy to cure for the time recommended by the manufacturer."
"","Remove the weight from the specimen after the epoxy has cured."
