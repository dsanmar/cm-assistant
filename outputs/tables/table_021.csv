"6.","Equipment as needed for AASHTO T 331."
"Procedure.  Perform the following steps:",""
"1.","Selecting Materials:"
"","a. 
Select the necessary type and source for each aggregate.  Obtain representative samples consisting of a"
"","minimum  of  23  kilograms  (50  lb)  of  each  aggregate. 
  Sample  the  aggregates  in  accordance  with"
"","AASHTO T 2."
"","b. 
Obtain an adequate quantity of the asphalt binder and additives (if necessary)."
"","c. 
Dry the aggregate to constant weight at a minimum temperature of 38 °C (100 °F)."
"","d. 
If the stockpile gradation is unknown, obtain the average washed gradation of each proposed aggregate"
"","stockpile in accordance with AASHTO T 11 and T 27.  Enter the stockpile gradations on the ‘Combined"
"","Gradation’ worksheet."
"","e 
Check the aggregate gradations for compliance with the applicable specifications.  Check the individual"
"","aggregate stockpiles for compliance with applicable specifications."
"","f. 
Check asphalt and additives for compliance with the applicable specifications."
"","g. 
If the specific gravity values for aggregate sources are unknown, determine the 24 hour water absorption,"
"","the bulk specific  gravity, and the  apparent specific gravity of the individual sizes of each aggregate in"
"","accordance with AASHTO T 84 and T 85.  Enter the results or the known values from previous history on"
"","the ‘Bulk Gravity’ worksheet."
"","h. 
Calculate the bin percentages with the proposed aggregate so that the blended combination will fall within"
"","the specified gradation ranges for the specified mixture type."
"","Note 1 - Consider material availability, mixture  strength, handling, compaction, pavement texture, and"
"","durability as the primary factors of the combination to be tested."
"","i. 
Determine 
the 
sand 
equivalent  value  of 
the 
combined  virgin 
aggregates 
in 
accordance  with"
"","AASHTO T 176."
"","j. 
Plot the combined gradation and specification limits using the ‘Power 45 Curve’.  Confirm that the blend"
"","meets the specification requirements."
"2.","Preparing laboratory Mixed Samples:"
"","a. 
Separate  the  materials  larger  than  the  #8  (2.36  mm)  sieve  into  individual  sizes  for  each  stockpile  for"
"","preparation of laboratory mixtures.  Separate the material passing the #8 (2.36 mm) sieve into individual"
"","sizes if it is prone to segregation."
"","b 
Select  2  asphalt  contents  around  the  anticipated  Optimum  Asphalt  Content  (OAC).    Select  the  asphalt"
"","contents within the allowed tolerances in accordance with specifications."
