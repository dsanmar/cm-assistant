"","NJDOT B-5 – DETERMINING COMPOSITION OF HMA MIXTURE USING HOT BIN"
"","SAMPLE ANALYSIS"
"A.","Scope.  This test method is used to determine the gradation and asphalt content of a HMA mixture by use of bin"
"","samples and printout ticket."
"B.","Apparatus.  Use apparatus according to AASHTO T 11, T 27, and T 37."
"C.","Procedure.  Perform the following steps:"
"","1. 
When  taking  samples  for  hot  bin  analysis,  apply  the  rates  of  sampling  to  the  plant’s  production  for  all"
"","Department projects rather than for individual projects."
"","2. 
Divide the production into successive lots of the size as specified in Section 902 for the mixture being sampled."
"","Take  5  samples  for  composition 
testing  from  each 
lot. 
  Take  5  samples  of 
the  HMA  as  specified 
in"
"","NJDOT B-2 for volumetric acceptance testing, maximum specific gravity testing, and comparison testing from"
"","each lot.  Time the HMA sampling to correspond with the hot bin samples."
"","3. 
The  ME  will  assign  consecutive  lot  numbers  for  each  type  of  mix  at  the  plant.    Include  the  assigned  lot"
"","identification number on each weigh ticket."
"","4. 
The ME will use a table of random numbers to select the ton of mix to be sampled for each sample in the lot."
"","Based on the ton of mix, determine the portion of the production to be sampled."
"","5. 
The supplier’s quality control technician shall take random samples of not less than 25 pounds from each hot"
"","bin for each 600 tons batched as directed by the ME.  When mineral filler is used, take a minimum of one filler"
"","sample per lot."
"","6. 
Use a minimum sample weight for testing of 25 pounds for bins No. 5 and No. 4, 10 pounds for bin No. 3, and"
"","2 pounds for bin No. 2.  Use a minimum test sample weight of 500 grams for bin No. 1 and 100 grams for"
"","mineral filler."
"","7. 
For  test  samples  from  bins  No.  2,  3,  4,  and  5,  weigh  the  sample  and  sieve  the  aggregate  according  to"
"","AASHTO T 27 down to the No. 8 sieve with a catch pan underneath.  Conduct the sieving operation by means"
"","of a mechanical sieve shaker.  If more than 2 percent of the aggregate is passing the No. 8 sieve, wash and grade"
"","that portion according to AASHTO T 11 and T 27."
"","8. 
Wash and grade the bin No. 1 test sample according to AASHTO T 11 and T 27."
"","9. 
For each bin, record the weight retained on each sieve determined in the grading process and the wash loss and"
"","pan weights for determination of the percent passing the No. 200 sieve."
"","10.  Wash and grade the mineral filler sample according to AASHTO T 37."
"D.","Calculations.  Calculate the asphalt content by dividing the recorded delivery ticket asphalt cement weight for the"
"","load by the total load weight."
"","Calculate the percent of material from each bin by dividing the recorded delivery ticket weights for each bin by the"
"","total aggregate weight of the load.  Calculate the mix gradation by computing the percentage of material passing each"
"","sieve for each bin and multiplying the percentage by the individual bin percentage and then summing the products"
"","for each sieve."
"E.","Report.  Report the asphalt content to the nearest 0.01 percent on the work sheet and the daily inspection report and"
"","rounded to the nearest 0.05 percent when reported on the lot data report."
"","Report bin percentages, bin gradations, and the mix gradation to the nearest 0.1 percent on the work sheet and daily"
"","inspection report.  On the lot data report, report the mix gradation to the nearest 0.5 percent on the No. 8 sieve, to the"
"","nearest 0.1 percent on the No. 200 sieve, and to the nearest 1 percent on all other sieves."
