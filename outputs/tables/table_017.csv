"","e. 
Turn over the glued specimen so the bottom of the base plates faces upward.  Using a hacksaw, cut a notch"
"","through the epoxy which can be seen through the gap in the base plates.  The notch should be cut as evenly"
"","as possible and should just begin to reach the specimen underneath the epoxy.  Great care should be taken"
"","not to cut more than 1/16 inch (1.58 mm) into the specimen."
"","f. 
Place the test sample assembly in the Overlay Tester’s environmental chamber for a minimum of 1 hour"
"","before testing."
"4.","Start Testing Device.  Please refer to manufacturer’s equipment manual prior to operating equipment."
"","a. 
Turn  on  the  Overlay  Tester.    Turn  on  the  computer  and  wait  to  ensure  communication  between  the"
"","computer and the Overlay Tester occurs."
"","b. 
Turn  on  the  hydraulic  pump  using  the  Overlay  Tester’s  software.    Allow  the  pump  to  warm  up  for  a"
"","minimum of 20 minutes."
"","c. 
Turn the machine to load control mode to mount the sample assembly."
"5.","Mounting Specimen Assembly to Testing Device.  Enter the required test information into the Overlay Tester"
"","software for the specimen to be tested."
"","a. 
Mount  the  specimen  assembly  onto  the  machine  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions  and  the"
"","following procedural steps."
"","1. 
Clean  the  bottom  of  the  base  plates  and  the  top of  the  testing  machine  blocks  before  placing  the"
"","specimen  assembly  into  the  blocks.    If  all  four  surfaces  are  not  clean,  damage  may  occur  to  the"
"","machine, the specimen, or the base plates when tightening the base plates."
"","2. 
Apply 15 pounds inch of torque for each screw when fastening the base plates to the machine."
"6.","Testing Specimen."
"","a. 
Perform testing at a constant temperature recommended by the New Jersey Department of Transportation"
"","for the mixture in question.  This is typically either 59 °F (15 °C) or 77 °F (25 °C)."
"","Note - Ensure the trimmed specimen has also reached the constant temperature required."
"","b. 
Start  the  test  by  enabling  the  start  button  on  the  computer  control  program.    Perform  testing  until  a"
"","93 percent  reduction  or  more  of  the  maximum  load  measured  from  the  first  opening  cycle  occurs.    If"
"","93 percent is not reached, run the test until a minimum of 1,200 cycles."
"","c. 
After the test is complete, remove the specimen assembly from the Overlay Tester machine blocks."
